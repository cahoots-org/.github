## 🎯 Mission

Cahoots is revolutionizing software development task management through intelligent AI-powered decomposition. We're building systems that break down complex software tasks into atomic, executable pieces of work that can be reliably handled by both humans and AI.

## 🚀 What We Do

**Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Our platform accepts high-level software development tasks and recursively decomposes them into subtasks until each piece becomes an atomic unit of work that can be executed with confidence.

**AI-First Architecture**: Built on a microservices architecture using Python/FastAPI, Redis, and modern AI frameworks like DSPy, we're creating the future of collaborative software development.

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 AI-powered task analysis and complexity scoring
- 🌳 Recursive task decomposition with visual tree representation
- ⚡ Real-time collaboration with WebSocket updates
- 🔐 OAuth authentication (Google, Apple)
- 📊 Advanced analytics and progress tracking
- 🎯 Atomic task detection and auto-completion
